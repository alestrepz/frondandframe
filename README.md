# Frond & Frame
### *Vegan Food Doesn't Have to Be Boring*
Frond &amp; Frame is a project I co-created where I develop vegan (often Asian-inspired) recipes. This repository hosts the code I'm using to build our GitHub Pages site.

As a data scientist, creating Tableau dashboards and stitching together ggplot visuals is the extent of my design skills, so I used an awesome theme from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme "Theme by mmistakes") as a template.
